Good morning, Ms. Negev, Mr. Chioda. I'm Ido.
Today I'd like to explain our suggestions for media mix promotions.
I heard you like to use flyers as your tool to attract more customers.
Yes, I thought flyers are good, but we have 10 restaurants.
So if the contents of all the flyers are the same,
then we'll place the map and address of a restaurant that won't be visited by prospects in specific areas.
And also, space for advertisement will be smaller. That doesn't make sense.
But making 10 different flyers for each restaurant will need more labor and higher printing costs.
